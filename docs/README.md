### Development Setup

1. **Clone and setup the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd outlook-ai-assistant/app
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. **Set up Azure AD (Required for Authentication):**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory
   - Configure redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
   - Get your Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID

4. **Add your configuration to `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   # NextAuth.js Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # Azure AD Configuration
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-azure
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-from-azure
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id-from-azure
   
   # AI Provider Configuration
   AI_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
   ```

5. **Generate NextAuth Secret:**
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure secret for JWT signing
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with your Microsoft account!

   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER=azure-openai
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
   AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
   ```

### Anthropic
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER=anthropic

   ```

## Customizing Your AI Assistant

### Personalizing AI Behavior

The AI's personality and capabilities are defined in `/context/prompt-context.txt`. You can customize this file to:

- **Change the AI's tone:** Make it more formal, casual, or industry-specific
- **Add company policies:** Include your organization's meeting rules or email guidelines
- **Customize templates:** Add your preferred email signatures or meeting formats
- **Focus on specific areas:** Emphasize certain productivity methodologies

**Example customizations:**

```text
# Make the AI more formal
You maintain a professional and formal tone at all times, using proper business language.

# Add company-specific guidance
When scheduling meetings, remind users that our company policy limits meetings to 50 minutes with 10-minute breaks.

# Customize email signatures
When drafting emails, suggest including our standard signature format:
[Name] | [Title] | [Company] | [Email] | [Phone]
```

### Adjusting AI Settings

Fine-tune the AI's responses by modifying environment variables:

```env
# More creative responses
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=1.0

# More focused responses  
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.3

# Longer responses
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=3000

# Enable response caching
AI_CACHING_ENABLED=true
AI_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=10
```

## Usage Examples

### Email Management
- "Help me organize my inbox"
- "Draft a response to Sarah about the project deadline"
- "What emails need my immediate attention?"
- "Create a template for meeting follow-ups"

### Calendar Scheduling
- "Find time for a 1-hour meeting with the marketing team"
- "What's my schedule looking like tomorrow?"
- "Help me reschedule my 2 PM call"
- "Block time for focused work this week"

### Productivity & Tasks
- "Show me my pending tasks"
- "Help me prioritize my work for today"
- "What productivity tips do you recommend?"
- "How can I better manage my time?"

## Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting
Control API usage to manage costs:

```env
AI_RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
AI_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=20
AI_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR=100
```

### Fallback Providers
Set up backup AI providers for reliability:

```env
AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
AI_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=openai,azure-openai
```

### Security Settings
The application includes built-in security features:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content filtering for inappropriate requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure API key handling

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**"Configuration Error" when signing in**
- **Cause:** Missing or incorrect environment variables
- **Solution:** 
  1. Verify all required environment variables are set in `.env.local`
  2. Generate a new `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using `openssl rand -base64 32`
  3. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your current domain exactly
  4. Restart the development server after making changes

**"Access Denied" error**
- **Cause:** Azure AD configuration or permissions issue
- **Solution:**
  1. Check that your Azure AD app has the correct redirect URI
  2. Verify API permissions are granted in Azure AD
  3. Ensure your Microsoft account has necessary permissions

**"OAuth Callback Error"**
- **Cause:** Redirect URI mismatch between Azure AD and your application
- **Solution:**
  1. In Azure AD, set redirect URI to: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/azure-ad` (development)
  2. For production: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
  3. Ensure no trailing slashes or extra characters

**Sign-in button doesn't work**
- **Cause:** Missing Azure AD configuration
- **Solution:**
  1. Complete Azure AD app registration setup
  2. Add all required environment variables
  3. Check browser console for error messages

### AI Service Issues

**"AI service is temporarily unavailable"**
- Check your API key in `.env.local`
- Verify your API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

**Chat button shows a warning icon**
- The AI service health check failed
- Check the browser console for error details
- Verify your environment variables are correct

**Responses are too generic**
- The context file might not be loading properly
- Check that `/context/prompt-context.txt` exists
- Review the file for any formatting issues

**"Too many requests" error**
- Rate limiting has been triggered
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Consider adjusting rate limits in your environment variables

### Development Issues

**Build failures**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Verify Node.js version is 18 or higher

**Environment variables not loading**
- Ensure `.env.local` is in the correct directory (`/app/.env.local`)
- Restart the development server after changing environment variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Getting Detailed Logs

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for error messages
3. Look at the Network tab to see API request details
4. Check the terminal running the dev server for server-side logs
